This is a team project that I did with my classmate at my Hochschule for the database course.

The main features of the project are:-

• Developed and implemented a database system using Postgre SQL to manage newborn’s birth information efficiently.

• Created detailed entries for newborns, capturing essential data such as ID, birth date, name, etc.

• Implemented categorization of newborns into two categories: healthy newborns and those requiring intensive care.

• Utilized comprehensive data including newborn details, parent information, health records, doctor details, and hospital resources.

• Designed a user-friendly system with tables for easy access to categorized data.
